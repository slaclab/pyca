# Explanation section:
# B950
#   This takes into account max-line-length but only triggers when the value
#   has been exceeded by more than 10% (96 characters).
# E203: Whitespace before ':'
#   This is recommended by black in relation to slice formatting.
# E501: Line too long (82 > 79 characters)
#   Our line length limit is 88 (above 79 defined in E501).  Ignore it.
# E226: Missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
#   This is a stylistic choice which you'll find everywhere in pcdsdevices, for
#   example.  Formulas can be easier to read when operators and operands
#   have no whitespace between them.
#
# W503: Line break occurred before a binary operator
# W504: Line break occurred after a binary operator
#   flake8 wants us to choose one of the above two.  Our choice
#   is to make no decision.
